        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Tegar, and Iâ€™m currently a student majoring in programming. 
          I am passionate about coding, solving complex problems, and creating innovative solutions with technology. 
          My journey in programming began with a curiosity to understand how websites and apps work.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a programmer, I have experience with various languages like <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, 
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and I am constantly learning new technologies to expand my skills. 
          I thrive on challenges and enjoy working on projects that allow me to grow and develop as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I love exploring art, enjoying beautiful aesthetics, and finding inspiration in nature and design. 
          One of my favorite hobbies is <strong>cycling</strong>. I find it refreshing to explore new places, feel the breeze, and unwind after a long day of programming. 
          Cycling helps me clear my mind, stay fit, and sometimes even sparks creative ideas for my projects!
